Phase 1: Core Setup and Initial Development (Weeks 1–2)
1. Environment Setup
Install Dependencies: Set up the environment to support all libraries and frameworks needed.

Libraries: fastapi, streamlit, huggingface, spacy, chromadb, tenacity, openai, etc.

APIs: Set up accounts and API keys for models (ChatGPT, HuggingFace, etc.).

Version Control: Initialize GitHub repo, set up .gitignore to exclude sensitive files like API keys.

Action Item:

Ensure you can securely store API keys (using .env files or encrypted secrets storage). You can use libraries like python-dotenv or deploy on platforms like Heroku, Vercel for automatic environment variable handling.

2. Database and Memory System Design
Basic File Structure:

Create a simple JSON structure to hold memory (conversation history, long-term memory).

Define separate memory files for different users.

Action Item:

For memory storage, start simple: JSON + ChromaDB vector storage.

Store the conversation history (raw messages, summaries) in JSON files.

Set up ChromaDB to store user facts as vectors for semantic search.

3. Personality Layer Development
Prompt Engineering:

Create a list of predefined responses, tone guidelines, and caring statements.

Example: When a user is feeling down, your chatbot should respond empathetically.

Develop a consistent tone based on Elysia’s core traits: caring, humble, and helpful.

Action Item:

Set up personality definitions in the codebase. This will act as a blueprint for how the chatbot communicates with the user.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
EMPATHY_TRIGGERS = {
  'stress': "It sounds like you're going through a tough time. I'm here for you.",
  'achievement': "That's an amazing accomplishment! You should be really proud of yourself.",
  'uncertainty': "It's okay not to have all the answers. Take it one step at a time."
}
4. Integrating Model APIs
Model Selection:

Start with HuggingFace’s free models and integrate ChatGPT API for premium users.

Implement API rotation for handling rate limits and maintaining conversation consistency.

Action Item:

Implement a function to manage API calls and handle failures gracefully due to rate limits.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
def get_response(prompt):
    for model in MODEL_PRIORITY:
        try:
            return model['api'](prompt)
        except RateLimitError:
            continue
5. User Authentication & Basic Interaction
Authentication:

Set up a basic user system (e.g., email or social login).

Allow users to create an account and choose the name for their companion.

Action Item:

Implement a simple sign-up/sign-in system (you can use fastapi with OAuth or JWT for authentication).

Create a welcome flow where users choose their companion's name.

Phase 2: Advanced Features (Weeks 3–4)
1. Memory & Context Management
Hybrid Context System:

Implement summarization every 5 messages to reduce memory size.

Integrate semantic search to recall relevant past interactions.

Action Item:

Write code to convert message history into vectors using spaCy or HuggingFace.

Implement a query system to fetch past memories based on embeddings.

2. Personality Adaptation
Customizable Personality:

Allow the chatbot to adjust its personality based on user preferences (e.g., more formal, more casual).

Use sentiment analysis to adjust the tone of responses.

Action Item:

Implement basic sentiment analysis using VADER or HuggingFace to analyze user emotions and adjust responses.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
def adjust_personality(response, sentiment):
    if sentiment['compound'] < -0.5:
        return "I sense you're feeling low. Let's talk it out."
    return response
3. Handling Multiple Models
Multi-Model Support:

Allow users to integrate different APIs (ChatGPT, HuggingFace, etc.) and use their own keys.

Create a function that dynamically switches between models depending on the user’s setup.

Action Item:

Set up API management so that users can input their API keys and store them securely.

Phase 3: Polishing & Deployment (Week 5)
1. Finalizing User Experience
User Interface:

Set up the front end using Streamlit or React to allow users to interact with Elysia.

Display personalized content (e.g., conversation history, emotional analysis).

Action Item:

Design simple but engaging UI elements (e.g., chat bubbles, a name tag for Elysia).

2. Deployment & Security
Secure Deployment:

Deploy the app using services like Heroku, Vercel, or AWS.

Ensure that all API keys and sensitive information are encrypted and securely handled.

Action Item:

Deploy the application with SSL encryption and ensure secure handling of user credentials and API keys.

Phase 4: Testing & Iteration (Week 6+)
1. User Testing
User Feedback:

Conduct beta testing with a small group of users to gather feedback on functionality and personality.

Monitor how users interact with Elysia and refine the personality layer based on feedback.

2. Continuous Improvement
Analytics:

Use tools like Google Analytics or custom logging to track interactions and improve response quality over time.

Action Item:

Refine the personality and memory handling based on user feedback, focusing on creating a more human-like, caring experience.
